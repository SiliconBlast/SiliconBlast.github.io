> This workshop shows how to build Keras models on GCP Notebook Instances. The Keras Model is the core of a Keras programme. A Model is constructed, compiled, trained and evaluated using their respective training and evaluation datasets. Upon satisfactory evaluation, the model is used to make predictions on previously unseen data.
