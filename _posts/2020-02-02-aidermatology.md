> The goal of this research is to develop a diagnostic model to identify pigmented and non-pigmented skin lesions in ethnic skin types. An AI model for the diagnosis of skin lesions will augment the work of dermatologists in providing enhanced skincare services across various demographics, particularly in remote under-served communities and also in others that are under-represented in specialist skincare support.
